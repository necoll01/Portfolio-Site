  <p>
    As part of a project in a web development class I took, I built a very rudimentary 
    website for beginner artists- which I simply dubbed <a href="#">Art 101</a>
    When I started my internship, I decided to take my little website to the next level.

    While studying for my associates I took a class called Web Page Development. The final project for this class required us to make a nine page website on a topic that we were familiar with, so I chose my lifelong hobby, art. I ended up building
    a very rudimentary "Intro To Art" site that featured my own art work. Each page had a paragraph or two describing different art mediums, and the site 
    architecture was linear with a back, home, and next button. Once I started my internship my first
    goal was to redo the site into a usable project for my portfolio. This started with creating a site mission statement and creating 
    a user friendly site navigation.
    <!-- insert planning pictures and maybe mission statement-->
</p>

<p>
    Once this was complete I created a wireframe and (mostly) new content for the site, which ended up changing slightly as I began formatting the content in HTML. During this process I learned a lot about web design, mainly CSS. All my new knowledge took
    my tiny informational site to a starting space for the beginner artist. I know that the new site has the ability
     to impact much greater than the old site with all of the changes 
     that I made in the development process.</p>
