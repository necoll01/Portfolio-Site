      <p>
        As part of a project in a web development class I took, I built a very rudimentary
        website for beginner artists- which I simply dubbed <a href="https://art101.nataliecollins.us">Art 101</a>
        When I started my internship, I decided to take my little website to the next level.
      </p>

    <p>
      While studying for my associates I took a class called Web Page Development. The final project for this class
      required us to make a nine page website on a topic that we were familiar with, so I chose my lifelong hobby, art.
      I ended up building
      a very rudimentary "Intro To Art" site that featured my own art work. Each page had a paragraph or two describing
      different art mediums, and the site
      architecture was linear with a back, home, and next button. Once I started my internship my first
      goal was to redo the site into a usable project for my portfolio. This started with creating a site mission
      statement and creating
      a user friendly site navigation.
      <!-- insert planning pictures and maybe mission statement-->
    </p>
          <h3>No matter your skill level or interest, <br>I hope that art can open doors for you. <br>
          - Art 101 Mission Statement</h3>
    
    <p>
      Once this was complete I created a wireframe and (mostly) new content for the site, which ended up changing
      slightly as I began formatting the content in HTML. During this process I learned a lot about web design, mainly
      CSS. All my new knowledge took
      my tiny informational site to a starting space for the beginner artist. I know that the new site has the ability
      to impact much greater than the old site with all of the changes
      that I made in the development process.</p>
