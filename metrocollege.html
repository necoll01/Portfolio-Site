      <h1>Building a Component Library</h1>
      <div class="about">
    <p>
    While finishing my last semester of college I have been working 
    at my internship with <a href="https://metro-college.com/">Metropolitan College.</a> 
    On my first day we talked about the main project that I would be completing 
    for them: a component library.
</p></div>

 <p> The first thing I had to do was really read up on component libraries. This 
included reading the documentation for two popular component
 libraries:  <a href="https://patternlab.io">Pattern Lab</a>
and <a href="https://fractal.build">Fractal</a>. After I felt confident in my knowledge, I began creating a set of
prototype components to use in both libraries.

</figure>
Once I had the sample components coded I ran both libraries and 
got a feel for the UI.
I then worked on writing matching configuration files for 
things like the handlebars in 
both programs and the notes section. 

After using both libraries I presented my findings to 
Metropolitan College: <br>

All though pattern lab had more of web presence and some pretty great
marketing, fractal's UI spoke for itself. Fractal is a lightweight 
and easy to use pattern library program with conveniently 
stamped documenation. This was in stark contrast to pattern lab's 
documentation, which is in the process of being updated to match the latest 
version of their library.
</p>

<p>If you are wondering if a component library would be the right choice for your site, I would consider asking
  yourself the following: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>How much time am I spending copying and pasting over HTML components from other pages in my site?</li>
    <li>Am I able to use a repository service to give my web developers access to the libary?</li>
    <li>Do I have any experience in JSON, Handlebars, and Node?</li>
  </ul>
  If it turns out you're doing a lot of tedious HTML work, use a repository system such as GitHub, and
  know enough about the programming languages above to be dangerous, I would say it's worth looking into 
  a component library program for your website. If you're looking for ideas for how a fully stocked component library would work
  in practice, Fractal has some great examples linked on their homepage.
