    <p>
    While finishing my last semester of college I have been working 
    at my internship with <a href="https://metro-college.com/">Metropolitan College.</a> 
    On my first day we talked about the main project that I would be completing 
    for them: a component library.

<!---
<p>Project Outline: <br></p>
<ol>
  <li>Read up on documentation for popular component libraries. 
    (we decided that the focus be put on fractal and patternlab.)</li>
  <li>Create a new component library project with two of the best frameworks</li>
  <li>Present on the basics of component libraries as well as the pros and cons of
    both of the frameworks that you used. 
  </li>
  <li>Make a component library framework recommendation for Metro College.</li>
</ol>

 <p> The first thing I had to do was really read up on component libraries. This 
included reading the documentation for two popular component
 libraries:  <a href="https://patternlab.io">Pattern Lab</a>
and <a href="https://fractal.build">Fractal</a>. After I felt confident in my knowledge, I began creating a set of
prototype components to use in both libraries.

Once I had the sample components coded I ran both libraries and got a feel for the UI.
I then worked on writing matching configuration files for things like the handlebars in 
both programs and the notes section. 

After using both libraries I presented my findings to Metropolitan College:
